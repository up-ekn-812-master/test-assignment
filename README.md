# Instructions

1. (optional) Follow the instruction in ["Happy git with R"](http://www.happygitwithr.com) to set up RStudio on your own computer, and make sure you can push to GitHub and pull from it.

2. (optional) If you installed git locally, clone your assignment repository into a dedicated homework folder, e.g. `ekn-812-2019-homework/` (or whatever you want to call it).

3. Open RStudio and create a new PDF document from the RMarkdown template. If you did not clone the assignment repository down from GitHub in steps 1-2, just save the .Rmd file in its own folder, e.g. `test-assignment/`.

4. Fill in the "author" field with your name and click "Knit".

5. Save the PDF and Rmd source.

6. (optional) If you set up git on your computer in step 1, commit the PDF and Rmd files. Push them to GitHub.

If you choose not to install git locally in step 1, simply upload your finished .Rmd and .pdf files via the GitHub web interface.
